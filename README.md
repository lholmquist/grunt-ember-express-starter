## A starter project for an ember project that will be served by an express.js server

### Install Dependecies

`grunt init`

### Dev Mode

`grunt dev`

This will watch the ember clients `dist` directory for changes and livereload them

Also watches server files for changes and reloads those too


_Note:  This is a WIP_
